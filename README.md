Introduction
------------

This is the artifact package accompanying our POPL 2020 submission titled _Provenance-Guided Synthesis of Datalog
Programs_. The paper presents a new algorithm to synthesize Datalog programs from input-output examples. We have
implemented this algorithm in a tool named ProSynth, and benchmarked them against the existing solvers, ALPS and
Difflog.

This artifact contains all three tools (ProSynth, ALPS, and Difflog), benchmark files, and scripts to reproduce the
experiments described in the paper. In this document, we will describe the outline of these experiments, how to run
them, and also describe how one may use ProSynth to solve Datalog synthesis problems of their own.

Installing the Artifact
-----------------------

One can either install this artifact natively or use the provided Docker image. We recommend the use of the Docker image
for smoother reproduction.

1. To install the artifact locally:
   a. Clone this repository
   b. Install the pre-requisites for ProSynth, ALPS, and Difflog. On a computer running Fedora 30, one would run the
      following command:
      ```sudo dnf install z3 z3-devel python3-z3 \
                          autoconf automake make sbt \
                          gcc gcc-c++ mcpp \
                          python python3 \
                          flex bison \
                          doxygen git ncurses ncurses-devel libtool sqlite sqlite-devel zlib zlib-devel \
                          tsp```
   c. Run the following commands in the main repository folder, `popl2020-artifact/`.
      i. Build Souffle
      ```cd prosynth/souffle
         ./bootstrap
         ./configure
         make```
      ii. Build Difflog
          ```cd difflog
             sbt compile```

Hardware and Estimated Time for Reproduction
--------------------------------------------

__TODO:__ How long do the experiments take to reproduce?

Mukund's SAL 308 desktop
With tsp -S 6, exp1 prepare takes 10 minutes
With tsp -S 6, exp1 prosynth takes 4 hours and 15 minutes
With tsp -S 4, exp2 prepare took 16 minutes
With tsp -S 6, exp2 run takes 1hr 46 minutes

We recommend having approximately 30 Gigabytes of free space to store intermediate results and log files.

__TODO:__ Explain the `tsp -S` command

We conducted our experiments on a server with an 18-core Xeon 6154 CPU clocked at 3 GHz and with 394 GB of RAM. However,
we only used the multiple cores to simultaneously run multiple experiments and iterate quickly. Furthermore, all
benchmarks are CPU-bound rather than memory-bound. We expect similar results to be obtained on workstations and laptops
with more modest memory resources.

Structure of the Experiments
----------------------------

In our experiments, we run ProSynth in two different modes, named `nprov-S` and `nprov-Delta` respectively. We will
explain these modes in more detail later in this documentation.

All results presented in the paper arise out of two experiments:

1. __Experiment 1:__ Run ProSynth (in both modes), ALPS, and Difflog on all benchmarks, with the standard set of
   candidate rules. ProSynth (in both modes) and Difflog are each run 32 times to capture variance in running times.

   The data from this experiment is used to produce __Tables 2 and 3__, and __Figures 6 and 8__ in the main paper. The
   data is also used to produce __Figure 2__ in the supplementary data provided as part of our response to the
   reviewers.

2. __Experiment 2:__ Run ProSynth (in `nprov-Delta` mode) on the `scc` and `1-object-1-type` benchmarks. Here, we vary
   the size of the set of candidate rules, and measure its effect on the time needed to synthesize the program. Each
   experiment is repeated 8 times to capture variance in running times.

   The data from this experiment is used to produce __Figure 7__ in the main paper, and __Figure 1__ in the
   supplementary data provided to the reviewers.

__TODO__: Generally note not to interpret whiskers too literally
